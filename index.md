# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
Second Milestone: My second milestone for the magic mirror project is setting up the third part modules. After looking at all the third party modules, I decided to change one of the default modules, and add three seperate modules. The three modules that I added was , MMM-BackgroundSlideshow, MMM-3Day-Forecast, and MMM-DynamicWeather. First, I changed the compliments module from "Wow, you look hot!", "You look nice!", etc to "Good Morning Ken", "Good Afternoon Ken", etc. Next, I downloaded the MMM-BackgroundSlideshow which changes the background of the magic mirror. This module was pretty simple to download. Next I downloaded the MMM-3Day-Forecast which shoes the forcast for 3 days of a spectfic city.. In order to download thos module, I needed to make an api key to have the information for the weather. I also needed to edit the latitude and longitude for where I want the weather forcast to be at. Lastly, I downloaded the MMM-DynamicWeather which displays some animations for the certain weather status. For example, if it is raining, there will be rain drops all over the screen. In order to download this, I also needed to make an api key and edit the location id.

# First Milestone
First Milestone: My first milestone for the magic mirror project is to set up the Raspberry Pi, connect it to Wifi, and set up the SSH and VNC to the Raspberry Pi. I downloaded the Raspberry Pi Imager on the sd card and then put it in the Raspberry Pi. In order for the program to show up on the monitor, I plugged the HDMI cable to the monitor so I could boot up the Raspberry Pi and plug the power supply to an outlet. Next, I plugged in my mouse, keyboard, and ethernet cable so I can navigate the screen. In order to remotely get access to the command line from another device with the same network, I will need to download SSH. I also downloaded VNC so I can have access to a full remote desktop from another device.
